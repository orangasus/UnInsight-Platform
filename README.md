# UnInsight
An anonymous feedback platform for university courses, developed during a hackathon (Hack for Humanity 2025)

## The Problem 🧩
Imagine how useful it would be to have a website where students could freely share their thoughts and experience related to courses they took

Whether they want to tell others how amazing the course was, or warn them about potential difficulties, that platform would be the right place to do that
Well, good news is you don't have to imagine anymore!

Our project helps students make more informed decisions about their studies and improves transparency of the teaching quality

## Features
Allow me to introduce Uninsight, an anonymous courses review platform. Let’s talk about the main features:
- 🔒 Anonymity, all reviews are anonymous so students will be comfortable sharing their experiences
- 🤖 AI moderation, so some students won’t get too comfortable while sharing
- 📊 Scientifically based metrics to provide maximum insight into the course quality
- ⭐ Professors rating calculated as average from associated courses
- 🔎 Search for courses with handy filters to ensure efficiency and better user experience

## Workflow
The workflow couldn’t be any simpler:
- 📝 Create an account and confirm your email
- 🔍 Search for an existing course, or request us to add a new one, and leave a review, filling out a quick form
- 👀 Or just look for courses that interest you to see what other students have to say about them
- 📈 Search for professors to see how well are they doing according to their students

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- Django and Django REST Framework Backend
- Nuxt and Vue for Frontend
